The Internet Age was upon us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was born and raised in a small community in rural Alabama.  The country.  The backwoods.  To give you an idea of how small the place was, my entire school (grades K-12) had around 800 students.  While I was fortunate enough that my family could afford to travel for vacation almost every year, I mostly lived a sheltered life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rode bikes down the dirt road and explored neighbors&#8217; hunting lands with my best friend in the summer.  We&#8217;d get up at dawn, grab some provisions, and cycle out for the day&#8217;s adventure.  We&#8217;d race old lawnmowers, build unstable treehouses, and swim in what were likely snake-infested creeks.  We&#8217;d camp out under the stars.  Our parents never asked where we were.  As long as we showed up for supper and took a bath a few times each week to scrub the dirt off, we were generally left up to our own imaginations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was another aspect of growing up in the &#8217;90s, and that was video games.  At 16, I spent most of the summer in the fields picking watermelons or throwing bales of hay onto a trailer.  It was hard work, but it kept me supplied with whatever video games I wanted.  When not out in the wild, my best friend and I would be glued to a 19-inch television playing the Nintendo 64 (and later the Sega Dreamcast).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I lived in this somewhat country-bumpkin bubble with no idea of the outside world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came the explosion of the internet.  My family never had a computer at home.  That left me to access this wonderful new thing during school hours or at a friend&#8217;s house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like pretty much every teen boy I knew at the time, the best use of the internet was logging into adult chatrooms and hoping to chat with a woman.  Yeah, the average teenage boy wasn&#8217;t doing anything productive with the internet, even in the &#8217;90s.  Big surprise there.  This isn&#8217;t groundbreaking news, folks.  Move along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were other uses of chatrooms, such as finding other gamers.  That&#8217;s where my original love of the internet began.  I could talk to people across the world about Nintendo and Sega games.  I even started getting pen-pals where we would exchange weekly emails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, there was this common saying among adults, &#8220;You don&#8217;t know who you&#8217;re talking to on that thing. It could be a fat, 40-year-old man living in his parents&#8217; basement.&#8221;  <em>Hey, why you throwin&#8217; shade at heavyset men?  Just tell me it could be a psycho.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My parents drilled this lesson into my brain.  School teachers did the same.  Like my peers at the time, I was required to use a pseudonym when going online.  The thought of using a real name was almost unheard of.  As teens, we&#8217;d joke about the basement-dwelling bogeyman who our parents and teachers warned us against.  It was all a game to us despite there being legitimate fears, particularly now that I have 20 years of hindsight at my disposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s where I came up with my username of <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/greenshady\">greenshady</a>, by the way.  One day I may even tell what it means.  One day.  For now, I&#8217;ll keep all of you who have asked about it over the years guessing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used that username for years because there was always this little voice in the back of my mind telling me to remain anonymous.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Anonymity in the Age of Transparency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not exactly sure at what point attitudes toward anonymity changed.  Social networks likely played a huge role transitioning us from silly screen names to using our real-life names on the internet.  Otherwise, it&#8217;d be harder for our real-life friends to find us on Facebook, Twitter, and elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This prevailing attitude toward anonymity didn&#8217;t limit itself to social networks.  More and more, people shunned the idea of anonymous posts or comments on blogs and elsewhere.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s likely some form of stardom attached to using real names as well.  Everyone is just one video, one blog post, or one tweetstorm away from their 15 minutes in the spotlight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even within the WordPress community over the years, I&#8217;ve witnessed a shift toward automatically disliking anonymous comments.  The prevailing idea is that a person&#8217;s contribution to a discussion has less worth if it&#8217;s hidden behind the veil of anonymity, that one&#8217;s opinions are invalid if they cannot be backed up by a real name. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It opens the person to attack not based on their ideas but on how they choose to present themselves online.  This is a part of the culture that is unhealthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a time when you can effectively be shut out from the modern-day public square for making one wrong statement, anonymity is more important than ever for some.  Often, there&#8217;s no recourse for missteps after you&#8217;ve been taken down by the angry horde over a lapse in judgment.  Once your name has been hauled through the mud and back again, there&#8217;s little you can do about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That little voice in the back of my mind, the one carefully crafted by my parents and teachers, is a reminder that a simpler period during the Internet Age once existed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other pockets of the internet where the pseudonym has persisted.  One area is in gaming.  You&#8217;d be the oddball if using a real name in an online multiplayer match.  <em>I suppose &#8220;Brett&#8221; or &#8220;Molly&#8221; doesn&#8217;t strike fear in the heart&#8217;s of enemies.</em>  The entire culture of online gaming is built upon anonymity, which is at odds with much of the internet world today.  Frankly, I find it oddly satisfying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do wonder whether a real name online is important for civil discourse.  Quite often, online personas are much different than their real-life counterparts.  I mean, have you seen the numerous alpha-male groups on social networks made up of men who all think they&#8217;re the leaders of the pack?  <em>Hmmm…maybe there was some truth to that basement-dweller theory, after all.  Thanks for the heads up, Mom and Dad.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point is that an online persona, even attached to a real name, is still a persona.  It&#8217;s not much different than a fake user handle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d wager that the need to see a person&#8217;s real name has more to do with knowing exactly who to shun for controversial ideas rather than attaching some sort of validity to it.  Usernames can be altered.  You&#8217;re pretty much stuck with your real name, and mishaps follow your real name around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we were reviewing the Tavern&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/comment-policy\">comment policy</a> last week, one point I brought up is that I believe we should allow anonymous comments.  A large reason for this is that people should feel safe to communicate their thoughts within the community.  While I won&#8217;t get into the specifics of internal discussions, I do hope that it&#8217;s something we officially remove from the policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being in favor of anonymity does not mean being in favor of personal attacks or handing over a license to use a vulgar term as a username.  It&#8217;s about protecting people&#8217;s ability to speak freely without fear of becoming an outcast within the community for an unpopular opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes anonymity provides people the freedom they need to effectively discuss ideas.  More importantly, it allows them to be a part of the community in a way that they choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are We Moving back?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the European Union, Japan, Australia, and other countries passing stricter privacy laws, there&#8217;s a growing movement to protect privacy across the world.  While this movement has focused more on large corporations and what they do with personal data, there&#8217;s an underlying fear that&#8217;s likely been there from the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are coming to the realization that we gave up too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We handed over our names.  And, once we handed over our names, it was a slippery slope to handing over everything else about ourselves.  If you dig deep enough you can find the names of all my cats and when they were all born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about that.  I&#8217;m in too deep at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My parents from 20 years ago would not have liked the idea too much.  My dad just uses YouTube to watch videos on building stuff for the most part today (it took years to stop him sending me email chains), but my stepmom is right there along with everyone else on social networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s odd to look back on the past 20 years to see how some of our initial fears surrounding anonymity have transformed.  In another 20 years, we&#8217;ll all be back to using pseudonyms again.  Call me out on it if I&#8217;m wrong.  I do wonder if we&#8217;ll look back at this time and think everyone was crazy for using their real names.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I welcome your anonymous comments on this post.  Just don&#8217;t use &#8220;wanker&#8221; for your handle.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wptavern.com/the-evolution-of-anonymity-in-the-internet-age/feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"94745\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"\n		\n		\n				\n				\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n				\n								\n							\n		\n							\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"GNU Project Maintainers Move to Oust Richard Stallman from Leadership\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/gnu-project-maintainers-move-to-oust-richard-stallman-from-leadership\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wptavern.com/gnu-project-maintainers-move-to-oust-richard-stallman-from-leadership#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 08 Oct 2019 04:33:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"News\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"FSF\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"GNU\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"gpl\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94714\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:448:\"GNU Project maintainers are working to oust Richard Stallman from his position as head of the organization.

His personal site was also reportedly <a href=\"http://techrights.org/2019/09/29/fsf-defaced-rms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vandalized</a> nine days ago with a message that he was stepping down from the GNU.</p>\n<p>The defacement with the false GNU resignation message was reverted shortly thereafter on September 30, and replaced with the header saying he continues to be &#8220;Chief GNUisance of the GNU Project&#8221; with no intention of stopping soon. Stallman has not yet publicly acknowledged the statement from the GNU maintainers. He has also not yet responded to our request for comment.</p>\n<p>Yesterday the Free Software Foundation (FSF) published a <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-and-gnu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> indicating it was re-evaluating its working relationship with the GNU project, which has provided some of its technical infrastructure, fiscal sponsorship, and copyright assignment:</p>\n<blockquote><p>GNU decision-making has largely been in the hands of GNU leadership. Since RMS resigned as president of the FSF, but not as head of GNU (&#8220;Chief GNUisance&#8221;), the FSF is now working with GNU leadership on a shared understanding of the relationship for the future. As part of that, we invite comments from free software community members.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Stallman responded the next day, indicating he wanted to work with FSF on restructuring the relationship between the two organizations:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I recently resigned as president of the FSF, but the FSF continues to provide several forms of crucial support for the GNU Project.  As head of the GNU Project, I will be working with the FSF on how to structure<br />\nthe GNU Project&#8217;s relationship with the FSF in the future.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The FSF maintains some critical responsibilities in that it currently <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#History\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">holds the copyrights to enforce the GPL</a>.

The earlier U.S. 9th Circuit court <a href=\"http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2019/01/15/17-55504.pdf\">ruled that websites fall under</a> Title III of the American with Disabilities Act (ADA).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original case was brought forth by Guillermo Robles, a blind man, who claimed the Domino&#8217;s website and app did not allow him to place an order in 2016.  Robles, like many other people with disabilities, relies on screen-reader software to use the web.  Despite using such software, he was not able to make an order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary issue of the case was whether the ADA applied to websites or apps in the same way that they applied to brick-and-mortar locations.  Title III specifically points out public places of accommodation but not websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The specific <a href=\"https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/titleIII_2010/titleIII_2010_regulations.htm\">section of the ADA</a> related to the case reads as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Section 36.201(a) contains the general rule that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation.</p><p>Full and equal enjoyment means the right to participate and to have an equal opportunity to obtain the same results as others to the extent possible with such accommodations as may be required by the Act and these regulations. It does not mean that an individual with a disability must achieve an identical result or level of achievement as persons without a disability.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9th Circuit decided the ADA also applied to businesses on the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were three key issues in the case: whether the ADA applied to the website and app, whether Domino&#8217;s had fair notice to comply, and whether the court or the Department of Justice (DOJ) should decide the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DOJ is the body that regulates the ADA. Since it was signed into law in 1990, the DOJ has not created specific guidelines for how businesses can ensure their websites are within the law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One argument is that it would have been cheaper and easier for Domino&#8217;s to follow accessibility standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).  Such arguments don&#8217;t address the need for meaningful regulations from a governing body.  The WCAG are not legal guidelines in the U.S. However, the 9th Circuit ruled that the lack of guidelines does not remove Domino&#8217;s responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Circuit Judge John B. Owens wrote in the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-1539/102950/20190613153344483_DominosPetitionAppendix.pdf\">9th Circuit decision</a>, &#8220;While we understand why Domino&#8217;s wants DOJ to issue specific guidelines for website and app accessibility, the Constitution only requires that Domino&#8217;s receive fair notice of its legal duties, not a blueprint for compliance with its statutory obligations.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of such regulations is why this case was important from Domino&#8217;s standpoint.  While they lost the case, it may further push the need for more specific guidelines for businesses, both large and small, to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of specific regulations could also be seen as <em>a feature rather than a bug</em>, to use a developer phrase.  Government-specific rules are often slow to keep up with the changing nature of the web.  Guidelines that apply one day may need to change soon thereafter.  It also leaves businesses the ability to make their websites accessible via a method of their choice rather than limiting what they can do to potentially bureaucratic rules that are out of touch with the modern web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, it could leave smaller business owners without large legal and website development budgets wondering if they could be looking at lawsuits in the future.  Courts were flooded with <a href=\"https://www.3playmedia.com/2019/06/12/2018sweb-accessibility-lawsuits/\">2,285 accessibility lawsuits in 2018</a>, which was nearly triple the 814 cases in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Does This Mean for Website owners in the U.S.?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the case, the Supreme Court didn&#8217;t make a ruling.  They denied Domino&#8217;s petition and left the decision of the 9th Circuit in place, which covers much of the western U.S.  In the coming years, more cases will make their way through the courts.  More than likely, case law will continue becoming stronger in favor of making websites compliant with the ADA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run an online business, it&#8217;s past time to make sure your website is accessible.  It could be years before the current law is amended or new ones are written on the legislative level.  The winds of change will likely not favor those with inaccessible websites as more court decisions come down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a nutshell, businesses with websites, apps, or other online presences need to make sure all people have access to their goods or services.  While there are no specific guidelines in the U.S., <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\">WCAG</a> is the largely agreed-upon standards internationally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a small business owner using WordPress, you should start with a WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/\">theme labeled as accessibility-ready</a>.  It is worth noting that &#8220;accessibility-ready&#8221; does not mean that your website will automatically become accessible.  It simply means that the WordPress theme meets a minimum number of accessibility guidelines.  Custom content on your website should also follow the same guidelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility is not a set-it-and-forget-it type of thing.

Previously, authors were able to submit code using newer PHP functions if they had a compatibility check in the same file.  However, newer syntax wasn&#8217;t allowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The issue was that the Linter (being stuck on 7.0) prevented anyone from checking in code via SVN that used 7.1+ standards,&#8221; said Mika Epstein from the plugin review team.  &#8220;So things like the Spaceship operator would fail on commit and you&#8217;d be told the syntax was invalid. This was holding back certain plugins from committing code into the directory.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Epstein first opened a <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3791\">ticket to address the issue</a> 13 months ago but said she&#8217;d been quietly asking for a fix for a while longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The max PHP version isn&#8217;t listed anywhere in the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/\">plugin guidelines</a>.  Technically, it&#8217;s an SVN limitation on WordPress.org and not something the plugin team chose.  However, for plugin authors, they may not have known about the issue until their plugin was rejected by the system.  They would then message the plugin team about the problem.  &#8220;I may end up putting something in the docs, but it&#8217;s a somewhat uncommon occurrence,&#8221; said Epstein.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been an issue for some plugin authors since PHP 7.1 was released, which was December 1, 2016.  &#8220;It was a once a year issue, then twice, and then it inched up to every couple months,&#8221; said Epstein.  &#8220;As of September, at least once a month someone would hit this and complain to plugins.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One potential problem with blocking newer PHP code is with plugins that rely on third-party libraries, which may only have security patches in more recent versions.  However, Epstein said that she was not aware of any security issues that resulted from the version limitation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrey &#8220;Rarst&#8221; Savchenko pointed out in the ticket that &#8220;7.2 was released almost two years ago.&#8221;  While he says it&#8217;s an improvement over the previous 7.0 limitation, version 7.2 should not be a hard ceiling for plugins in the repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP 7.3 was released on December 16, 2018, and PHP 7.4 <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-php-7-4-for-wordpress-developers\">will be released</a> on November 28, 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Given PHP&#8217;s poor adoption curves,&#8221; responded Dion Hulse, &#8220;all that this means is that you can&#8217;t release a plugin through WordPress.org that only works on 15% of WordPress sites.  &#8220;You can even use newer functions in PHP if including compat code, just not newer syntax.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugin author Josh Pollock <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Josh412/status/1100487567236059136\">called awareness to the issue</a> on Twitter in February.  &#8220;Hours later, I&#8217;m downgrading a dependency, because it requires another dependency, which requires PHP 7.1.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think we got lucky and there were no bugs,&#8221; Pollock said of downgrading to an earlier version of the dependency.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve used SVN since. I&#8217;m really fortunate that&#8217;s not a part of my life anymore.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I agree with Rarst,&#8221; said Pollock.  &#8220;We should be allowing for PHP 7 and making it easier for plugins not to support sites on out of date versions of PHP.&#8221;  This echoes the sentiment of other developers who are pushing for WordPress to adopt newer standards or at least allow them to do so in their own plugins in the official directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the majority of plugin authors, this should be a non-issue as long as the SVN system remains updated to match the version of PHP used on WordPress.og.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP 7.2 will lose active support on November 30, 2019, and security support on November 30, 2020.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-bumps-php-maximum-for-plugin-directory-to-version-7-2/feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"94637\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"\n		\n		\n				\n				\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n				\n								\n							\n		\n							\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:124:\"Matt Mullenweg and David Heinemeier Hansson Discuss WordPress Market Share, Monopolies, and Power in Open Source Communities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:143:\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-and-david-heinemeier-hansson-discuss-wordpress-market-share-monopolies-and-power-in-open-source-communities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:152:\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-and-david-heinemeier-hansson-discuss-wordpress-market-share-monopolies-and-power-in-open-source-communities#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 03 Oct 2019 18:59:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"News\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"automattic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"open source\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94234\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:508:\"In what began as a heated conversation on Twitter, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg and Ruby on Rails creator and Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson took to the airwaves to debate opposing viewpoints on market share, monopolies, and power in open source communities.

He also referenced Shopify as having a thriving business with a small percentage of the e-commerce platform market share.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even though open source can become a bit of a standard, it doesn&#8217;t prevent others from starting on it,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;The truth is if I had an evil hat on &#8211; let&#8217;s say I started doing evil monopoly stuff, people could easily fork the software &#8211; and they would. There&#8217;s a checks and balances there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-governance-project-looks-for-new-leadership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">classic power dynamic in BDFL-led open source projects</a> where the potential for a fork checks the project leader&#8217;s actions.</p>\n<p>Hansson challenges Mullenweg&#8217;s assertion that a fork would be a threat to the project, arguing that this power is illusionary when a project has become as dominant as WordPress:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Technically someone could fork Ruby on Rails tomorrow. What is the likelihood that fork is going to succeed? Once you have this juggernaut of network effects, WordPress is growing so much faster than anyone else, the gravitational pull is huge. Should someone fork it, introducing incompatibilities, what is the likelihood that is going to be a serious contender? From me, my assessment is extremely low, just the same as if someone was to fork Ruby on Rails today and call it Snoopy on Pails. The odds of that being anything other than a curiosity for two days on Hacker News is extremely low.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The notion of Snoopy on Pails injected a bit of humor into the debate that remained high intensity for the hour-long discussion, but it also illustrated Hansson&#8217;s point regarding the absurdity of any kind of WordPress fork becoming a real threat to the project&#8217;s momentum.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">it was a privilege to have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@photomatt</a> come on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reworkpodcast?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@reworkpodcast</a> and debate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@dhh</a> on tech monopolies and power dynamics in open source: <a href=\"https://t.co/Aewq4QTwFe\">https://t.co/Aewq4QTwFe</a>.

The whole reason someone is able to raise that kind of money is off the back of someone who can pitch: &#8216;We have over a third of all websites on the internet and we think we can get to 85%.&#8217; That&#8217;s a very compelling venture story.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg counters that if a Rails fork couldn&#8217;t attract a lot of users, that speaks to the Hansson&#8217;s stewardship of the project. He said that a typical WordPress release has 400-500 contributors with an estimated 10% from Automattic.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If 200 of those went someplace else because I did something really brain dead, that would be a pretty serious competitor, and there are some examples of that in open source history,&#8221; Mullenweg said. He contended that forks with enough weight behind them can become very interesting. On this point the two project leaders remained at odds.</p>\n<h3>How Open Source Market Dominance Impacts Diversity of Tools and Services on the Web</h3>\n<p>One of Hansson&#8217;s chief concerns with WordPress reaching 85% market share is what he described as the &#8220;death of diversity.&#8221; He perceives this pursuit of increased adoption as growing open source in monopolistic ways.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re living through an era right now where a small handful of big tech companies are exerting a completely undue amount of power over the internet, over discourse, over all sorts of things, and that&#8217;s something we should try to recoil from and at least learn from, not aspire to building more of,&#8221; Hansson said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what got this going &#8211; why isn&#8217;t WordPress in a great place only being a third of all the sites of the internet. Why does it need to get to 85%? Why does its growth need to be that explosive and that wild?&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is a question many in the WordPress community have asked in the past. Does the mission of democratizing publishing necessitate such a zealous drive towards market dominance?</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to see this concentration of power in one engine, no matter how good it is,&#8221; Hansson said.</p>\n<p>It is at this juncture that Mullenweg revealed more of his vision for WordPress becoming the &#8220;operating system of the web,&#8221; an idea he has floated several times over the past few years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You have referred to WordPress a lot of times as blogging,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;I think of it more like a platform. If you look at how a lot of people are building on it, they use WordPress to bootstrap something that doesn&#8217;t look like WordPress at all. It might not even have a website. It might be powering just an API. It might be a headless or decoupled installation. It could be a store.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He likened the idea to Apache and nginx having a dominant market share (<a href=\"https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/web-and-application-servers/apache-http-server-market-share\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">55%</a> and <a href=\"https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/web-and-application-servers/nginx-market-share\">23%</a> respectively) in the server space.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t prevent the different types of websites that are built on it,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;If nginx got to 80 or 85%, that wouldn&#8217;t prevent the diversity or what people could put on their websites. WordPress could get to 85% and it wouldn&#8217;t mean that there&#8217;s any sort of monoculture or lack of diversity. If anything, it would allow people to focus more on what&#8217;s different and not recreating the WYSIWYG, the user system, the login, all that stuff we have all built a million times and you just don&#8217;t need to anymore, if something like WordPress solves your needs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hansson asked what it would look like if 85% of the web ran on WordPress, a question that the community behind the project hasn&#8217;t deeply examined yet. He encouraged listeners to consider what they want the internet to look like in the future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What is the future I&#8217;d like to live in? What does a healthy, open, free internet look like? To me it looks like an internet with tons of different providers, tons of different tools, and what we collaborate around is protocols, not consolidation of software market share, that gives individuals and companies or even projects outsized power to dictate the matters of the internet.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Matt clarified that his comments on an 85% market share are not a goal, but rather a &#8220;trailing indicator&#8221; in the quest to create the best possible experience for developers and users. A growing market share is a signal of adoption in that sense, not a goal in itself.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Community Reactions to the Debate</h3>\n<p>After the initial exchange on Twitter, the broader tech community seemed delighted to hear Mullenweg and Hansson square off in a civil debate on topics that affect so many people working on the web. The conversation touched on a lot of the friction points in the WordPress ecosystem with Automattic being one of the most powerful companies driving WordPress&#8217; market share. Many listeners were grateful for answers to questions they have had for years.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Not sure <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@dhh</a> realizes it, but he spoke for hundreds if not thousands of WordPress community members that have had similar questions for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@photomatt</a> spanning the last few years. Most aren’t afforded the same opportunity or carry the same clout to have it.  <a href=\"https://t.co/z7wSIGJKAZ\">https://t.co/z7wSIGJKAZ</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Medeiros (@mattmedeiros) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattmedeiros/status/1179201126878629888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 2, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>However, the idea of WordPress as web infrastructure and the level of market dominance (85%) discussed in the podcast are controversial and even off-putting for some who are deeply invested in the platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Matt appears to think of WordPress as infrastructure for the web, in the same way that Google and Facebook think of themselves as infrastructure for the web,&#8221; Morten Rand-Hendriksen said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the conversation about the dangers of market control, monopolization, and monoculture, Matt says, &#8216;We are not a grain, we are the soil.&#8217; The only way to interpret that from my position is &#8216;WordPress is not a thing on the web. It is the web,&#8217; i.e. infrastructure. A future where WP is web infrastructure is something I think very few people actually want, open source or not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On the podcast, Mullenweg argued that open source allows for competition in a way proprietary software does not, but Rand-Hendriksen said he sees this as a logical fallacy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He talks at the same time about WP being infrastructure and powering 85% of the web AND about this being a reason for others to fight it with other solutions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So monopolization leads to competition somehow. I don&#8217;t think WordPress is infrastructure, or that it should power 85% of the web, especially after hearing this conversation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we truly believe in this idea of open source as diversification and forking, WP should actively support other projects and try to not be the dominant force on the web. WP is not infrastructure, it is very much a grain that has become a monoculture.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Matt Medeiros, host of the <a href=\"http://youtube.com/themattreport\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Report podcast</a> focused on WordPress business and entrepreneurs, said that while the conversation answered a lot of questions, it left him wanting more.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The cloud of uncertainty that hangs above a large portion of this community is directly formed from lack of clear communication in both <a href=\"http://WordPress.org\">WordPress.org</a> and how Automattic + Jetpack move in lockstep with the open source project,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;As we see hundreds of millions of dollars invested, with billions of dollars of valuation going to a single company, surely the optics leave one wondering how all of this gets repaid to investors?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Automattic invariably comes under more public scrutiny regarding its investments due to having the WordPress project lead as its CEO. One interesting observation Mullenweg made during podcast is that Automattic is just one of many larger players that make up the the WordPress economy, which he has previously estimated at $10 billion/year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Automattic makes probably 2-3% of the revenue in the WordPress world,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;There are companies like GoDaddy, which might not contribute very much back to core, but probably have 3 or 4 times the number of subscribers than us running WordPress. I think about that a lot. I want to grow the whole ecosystem, not just our slice of it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Revenue is not always equal to influence, and a good portion of the end of the podcast tackled questions about power and leadership in open source.</p>\n<p>&#8220;David&#8217;s questions are spun from the threads that fear monopoly on the web, as much as we fear a singular rule of decision making in the open source project,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;I think David did well at challenging Matt&#8217;s view on the desire of world domination and how undesirable it is to earn the title of Benevolent Dictator &#8212; but it left me wanting more. For example, in an attempt to throw a curveball, Matt pointed out, the investment is made in Automattic &#8212; not WordPress &#8212; a point so opaque it didn&#8217;t fool David, but didn&#8217;t have him pressing any deeper.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Had David viewed this conversation through the lens of our community, he would know that Automattic and WordPress.com enjoy the full benefit of leveraging the WordPress brand, a brand protected by a foundation that Matt himself founded, which may have guided the podcast episode into the ethics of it all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Mullenweg&#8217;s claim that &#8220;WordPress belongs to you as much as it belongs to anyone else&#8221; is true in the sense that the software is freely available to be used and modified by anyone, the full power of <a href=\"http://wpandlegalstuff.com/using-wordpress-trademarks-business-product-service/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">leveraging the WordPress brand</a> does not belong to everyone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Matt would have been willing to have this kind of conversation with me or most members from the the general community, so I&#8217;m glad someone of David&#8217;s clout was able to engage here,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;I do sympathize with all that Matt is responsible for and it&#8217;s not a challenge I think I&#8217;d be up for, given the opportunity. I love this community and want to see people stay, contribute, and flourish &#8212; not walk away because they felt unheard. DHH isn&#8217;t the hero we asked for, but he&#8217;s the hero we need right now.

In defending their positions, both reveal how their experiences of the early days of the web shaped their ideologies and approaches to open source project leadership and commercialization.

These events, called &#8220;review shindigs,&#8221; are marathon sessions where the team joins together to review themes and teach best practices.  The current plan is to hold the event on the first Saturday of every month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The goal of the review weekend is to get together and do as many quality reviews as possible,&#8221; wrote Carolina Nymark, one of the team&#8217;s review representatives, in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/10/03/review-weekend\">event&#8217;s announcement</a>.  Events sometimes have different goals, depending on what the team needs to work on at the time.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the event will happen over the team&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/themereview\">Slack channel</a>.  They will also hold a live presentation or Q&amp;A on Zoom at 13:00 UTC.  Anyone is welcome to attend (the Zoom link will be provided in Slack).  This will help teach those who are interested in how to perform reviews and check common issues.  Anyone attending is also able to submit topics for discussion in the comments on the announcement post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TRT originally <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/09/24/meeting-notes-for-tuesday-24th-september-2019/\">announced plans</a> for the event after the last team meeting, but it was overshadowed by other news, such as the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/theme-review-team-restructures-into-project-representatives\">team moving to a flat structure</a>.  &#8220;Not sure if anyone but myself will be there,&#8221; joked Nymark.  &#8220;It&#8217;s short notice.  Some of the team reps already had other plans.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone from the WordPress community is allowed to participate in the event by simply commenting on a ticket without being assigned a review.  Nymark provided links on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/\">how to become a reviewer</a> and the team&#8217;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/onboarding-for-new-reviewers/\">reviewer onboarding process</a> to get new reviewers started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review shindigs can help new reviewers because it puts them in touch with more experienced reviewers at a time when they know someone will be online to answer questions.  They&#8217;re also a team-building exercise where people can join together and work toward a common goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/\">214 tickets</a> are awaiting review. A successful event would significantly cut that number down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Events From the Past</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme review shindigs have seen varying levels of success over the years.  In the TRT&#8217;s earliest days, review gatherings were regular events and helped keep the ever-growing ticket queue under control.  Participation waned over time as leaders within the team switched to other projects or no longer had time to run the events.  Proposals to bring back them back have not gone far in the last couple of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last TRT shindig was a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2016/12/05/december-shindig-recap/\">December 2016 event</a> that saw over 50 participants.  Reviewers worked on 108 tickets throughout the weekend.  The event also coincided with contributor day at WordCamp US, which helped bump up participation numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jose Castaneda, Cristiano Zanca, Benjamin Lu, and Afzaal Ahmed held a live stream that covered how to load scripts and styles in themes in the previous review event.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\'youtube-player\' type=\'text/html\' width=\'627\' height=\'353\' src=\'https://www.youtube.com/embed/HW4dP0ikNmQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent\' allowfullscreen=\'true\' style=\'border:0;\'></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-brings-back-review-shindigs/feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"94599\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"\n		\n		\n				\n				\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n				\n								\n							\n		\n							\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"First Look at PHP 7.4 for WordPress Developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-php-7-4-for-wordpress-developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-php-7-4-for-wordpress-developers#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 02 Oct 2019 18:16:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"php\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94552\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:409:\"PHP 7.4 is slated for release on November 28, 2019.

WordPress 5.3 will also <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47783\">include several commits</a> that address deprecated features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that most WordPress plugin and theme developers will be able to use the new PHP 7.4 features for a while except when working on setups where they have some measure of control over the environment.  Given WordPress&#8217; reluctance to bump the minimum PHP version to the latest supported versions, it could be years before it&#8217;s safe to use new features.  However, developers should make sure their plugins and themes are compatible with 7.4.  It&#8217;s also good practice to keep up with current features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.2 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/05/jaco/\">bumped the minimum requirement</a> to PHP 5.6 with a recommendation of PHP 7.3.  The following is the breakdown for current <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">PHP usage stats</a> for WordPress installs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>PHP 7.3 &#8211; 9.6%</li><li>PHP 7.2 &#8211; 22.2%</li><li>PHP 7.1 &#8211; 13.5%</li><li>PHP 7.0 &#8211; 14.9%</li><li>PHP 5.6 &#8211; 25.7%</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, PHP 7.2 and 7.3 are the only versions receiving active support.  PHP will drop security support for version 7.1 on December 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP 7.4 includes a number of <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration74.php\">new features</a> that will make writing code easier.  The following is a small overview of some of the features that will likely be useful for WordPress plugin and theme authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Typed Properties</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP first introduced type hinting in 5.0 and has continued improving the feature.  PHP 7.0 introduced return type declarations.  PHP 7.4 steps it up a notch and allows developers to declare types for class properties.  This lets developers make sure the type of data assigned to a specific property is always that data type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following example, the <code>$id</code> property can only be assigned an integer and the <code>$title</code> property a string.  Attempting to assign the wrong data type will result in a fatal error if strict types are declared.  Otherwise, PHP will coerce the value to the correct type.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\">\nclass Event {\n\n    public int $id;\n\n    public string $title;\n}\n</pre>\n\n\n<h3>Arrow Functions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many developers have been clamoring for arrow functions similar to JavaScript. They are pretty sweet to use.  However, PHP&#8217;s arrow functions, also called &#8220;short closures,&#8221; are slightly different.  PHP 7.4 introduces the <code>fn</code> keyword (now a reserved keyword).  Short closures can only contain one expression and have no <code>return</code> keyword.  They&#8217;re not quite as powerful as their JavaScript cousins, but they do offer a quick solution for some scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the following code snippet shows two different ways to build an array of user emails from a collection of user objects.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\">\n// Old way, but still acceptable.\n$value = array_map( function( $user ) {\n    return $user-&gt;user_email;\n}, $users );\n\n// New way.\n$value = array_map( fn( $user ) =&gt; $user-&gt;user_email, $users );\n</pre>\n\n\n<h3>Unpacking Inside of Arrays</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Argument unpacking was <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration56.new-features.php\">introduced in PHP 5.6</a>, so this may still be unfamiliar territory for many developers in the WordPress space.  It&#8217;s been an invaluable feature in some of my projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP 7.4 allows developers to unpack an array within an array.  This should be faster than <code>array_merge()</code> because the spread operator (<code>...</code>) is a language construct rather than a function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the following example of injecting an array of two colors within a larger array of colors.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\">\n$colors_a = [ \'green\', \'blue\' ];\n\n$colors_b = [ \'red\', ...$colors_a, \'yellow\', \'purple\' ];\n\n// [ \'red\', \'green\', \'blue\', \'yellow\', \'purple\' ];\n</pre>\n\n\n<h3>Null Coalescing Assignment Operator</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The null coalescing assignment operator is a shorthand way of combining an <code>isset()</code> check with a ternary operator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following example shows how to check the <code>$product[\'id\']</code> variable.  If it&#8217;s set, do nothing.  Else, assign it the value on the right.  You can see the evolution of the code between PHP versions.  It&#8217;s much simpler to write in 7.4.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\">\n// Pre-PHP 7.0.\n$product[\'id\'] = isset( $product[\'id\'] ) ? $product[\'id\'] : 0;\n\n// PHP 7.0.\n$product[\'id\'] = $product[\'id\'] ?? 0;\n\n// PHP 7.4.\n$product[\'id\'] ??= 0;\n</pre>\n\n\n<h2>Deprecated Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP 7.4 will deprecate several features.  Plugin and theme authors will want to <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration74.deprecated.php\">consult the complete list</a> to determine whether they should update any outdated code.  I cherry-picked a few items that I&#8217;ve seen in plugin and theme code over the last few years.  Most other deprecated features are unlikely in current code bases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Nested Ternary Operators Without Parenthesis</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nested ternary operators are generally something you should avoid as a developer.  Seriously.  Just don&#8217;t write them.  They&#8217;re tough to follow and are prone to bugs due to human error.  However, if you&#8217;re going to throw caution to the wind and dismiss good advice, at least use parenthesis.

Last year, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-studiopress\">WP Engine acquired StudioPress</a>.  After staying on board for the remainder of his contract, Gardner stepped down from his role with the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The past 15 months have gone by quickly, and it sometimes feels like yesterday that we made the announcement,&#8221; Gardner said in his post. &#8220;In the same breath, it has also felt like forever.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many in the WordPress community, Gardner needs no introduction.  He&#8217;s the founder of <a href=\"https://studiopress.com\">StudioPress</a> and co-created Genesis with Nathan Rice, one of the most popular WordPress themes today.  In many ways, he&#8217;s the father of the modern professional WordPress theme ecosystem, becoming one of the first theme authors to figure out that you could make a living by providing WordPress products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s unafraid of letting his personal geek flag fly in his online life. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bgardner/status/6776616143294464\">quotes Sarah McLachlan</a>, is a self-affirmed Starbucks addict, runs marathons, and loves family trips to Disney World.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many theme authors in the WordPress community, he&#8217;s an inspiration.  Even as a former business competitor, I&#8217;ve always admired his work.  More than that, I&#8217;ve admired how he runs his business.  He never needed to be flashy.  He never needed to create controversy for PR.  He, almost quietly, built up a successful company.  The splashes he made came from the products he and his company released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2007, Gardner released the Revolution WordPress theme to the public for sale. Some may argue that Revolution was the catalyst for the commercial WordPress themes ecosystem.  There were several theme business startups around the same time.  Revolution at least played a pivotal role in the market&#8217;s early growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gardner launched the Revolution business in 2008, but quickly <a href=\"https://www.studiopress.com/revolution-rebrands-as-studiopress/\">rebranded to StudioPress</a> in 2009 after some legal issues with the name. By late 2010, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/studiopress-sold-to-copyblogger\">StudioPress merged with Copyblogger</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hindsight: The Biggest Regrets After 12 Years</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When building a successful company, it&#8217;s easy to look back on things that could&#8217;ve been handled differently.  There are deals passed up, ideas that flopped, and products that didn&#8217;t scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My biggest regret was not starting with (or switching to) a recurring business model,&#8221; said Gardner.  &#8220;I think I left a lot of money on the table by not doing that, but once I merged StudioPress into Copyblogger Media, we decided to leave it as is and use the former as a doorway into our company&#8217;s ecosystem.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many theme companies in the early days had lifetime sales.  It&#8217;s unlikely many could foretell how they&#8217;d need to scale for 10 or 20 years down the line.  The concept was relatively new in the WordPress space.  Gardner kept up with the model despite most theme shops moving to subscription-based sales, which typically scale better in the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>From a personal standpoint, I think I could have done better. There were a few seasons (some short and others a bit longer) where I strayed away from my involvement at StudioPress. While I justified it by thinking that it was OK to pursue side projects and other things, I realize looking back that jeopardized the trust our customers had in the brand. I think I may have leaned too heavily on the fact that we had a team, but in the same breath, I think it was necessary for StudioPress to outgrow the label of &#8216;Brian Gardner themes.&#8217; This emphasis really helped with the transition after WP Engine acquired StudioPress.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building a Community Over Software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Without a doubt, it&#8217;s the <a href=\"https://genesis.community/\">Genesis community</a>,&#8221; Gardner said when asked what he&#8217;s most proud of with his time at StudioPress. &#8220;When Nathan Rice and I set out to build Genesis (the framework), we were trying to solve a software problem and bring a better user experience for our customers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of building software, he learned what he was building was a community.  After creating a showcase page for people using the Genesis theme, he kept getting requests for people to build child themes.  This led to the creation of the <a href=\"https://www.studiopress.com/genesis-developers/\">Genesis Developers</a> page, which provided a way for people within the community to earn a living.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While community has always been important to me,&#8221; Gardner said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize the ripple effect that creating a solid piece of software would have.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gardner said the developers page created a way to pay it forward to the people who had helped him build a successful company.  The idea has remained a success, and there are many designers within the larger WordPress community who list custom Genesis design work in their credentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I have had the pleasure of being able to meet and spend time with members of the community—from talking about their success to future plans,&#8221; said Gardner.  &#8220;This past year at WordCamp US in Nashville, I was able to fully comprehend the level in which lives had been changed by what we had done—and those are the moments I could not be any prouder of what I built.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What&#8217;s on the Horizon?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Heh. The million-dollar question, right?&#8221; responded Gardner to whether he plans to continue building themes.  He doesn&#8217;t have any plans to create a new theme business, and any themes that he does build will be built for Genesis and made available from his website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Over the past few years, I have developed a particular love for minimalist design, and I want to spend some of my time and creative energy there.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gardner is currently available for hire as a website designer through <a href=\"https://authentik.com/\">Authentik</a>, a design and development studio that he founded.  Authentik specializes in branding and growth/audience building.  The team builds everything from landing pages to more complex multi-system environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there may be more to come from Gardner in the future.  &#8220;I have created some personal space to pursue collaborations and consulting,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I have a renewed focus on my blog and want to spend more time consuming content—reading books, listening to podcasts, and meeting up with folks locally. My heart to help fellow creators is as strong as ever, and I feel there are some really interesting opportunities to do that.&#8221;</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wptavern.com/brian-gardner-steps-down-from-studiopress/feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"6\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"94449\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"\n		\n		\n				\n				\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n				\n								\n							\n		\n							\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"Gatsby Days London Features Multiple WordPress Presentations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/gatsby-days-london-features-multiple-wordpress-presentations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/gatsby-days-london-features-multiple-wordpress-presentations#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 01 Oct 2019 17:41:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"News\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"gatsby\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94405\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:400:\"Gatsby Days London kicked off yesterday with a lot of momentum after Gatsby Inc. announced a $15M Series A funding round last week.

Although Gatsby is currently geared primarily towards developers, Mathews described how the project is working towards enabling people in other roles who also work on websites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re thinking really hard about how we can help everyone who works on a website, not just developers,&#8221; Mathews said. &#8220;Right now, Gatsby is essentially for developers, but our goal isn&#8217;t to help developers per se. Our goal is to help amazing websites be created.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This matters because the world runs on websites. More and more essential services that everyone relies on are websites and web apps, and we want to help with that. Developers are a key part of building websites but the actual process of building a web property is an incredible cross functional job for an organization to take on.&#8221; This process often includes designers, content editors, marketing professionals, and others.</p>\n<p>Gatsby, Inc.&#8217;s first cloud service, <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/preview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CMS Preview</a>, was inspired by this goal of assisting non-developers who work on websites.
